# Backend Systems

Production-grade backend services built in Python, designed to demonstrate
real-world system design, API architecture, and AWS deployment patterns.

## Philosophy
- API-first design
- Explicit error handling
- Idempotent operations
- Async where it matters
- No toy systems

## Services
- Notification Engine (Email / SMS / WhatsApp) – In progress

## Tech Stack
- Python
- FastAPI
- AWS (EC2, Lambda, SQS)
- Redis (where applicable)

This repository reflects how I build backend systems in real production environments.
